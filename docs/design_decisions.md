# Design decisions

The architectural decisions behind Iconic CAD, with the reason and the cost of
each. Recorded so a future contributor (human or agent) understands *why* the
tool is shaped this way and what they'd give up by undoing it.

This doc records **decisions** (constraints that are true about the design).
Framing, philosophy, and the target scenarios live on the design-decisions slide,
not here. Plans for unbuilt features live in their scoping docs; only the settled
decisions they produce graduate into this file.

These decisions serve two target scenarios (see the slide): a campus swarm build
(many people assembling one house in a weekend) and a remote single-house order
(fabricated on-site, off-grid, from the generated files). They are cited as
rationale below rather than restated as their own section.

---

## 1. No backend — the tool is fully static

The browser does everything, including the FreeCAD `.FCStd` export, with no
server.

**Why.** Distribution becomes trivial: host it anywhere, run it offline, run it on
an air-gapped build site with no connectivity (the remote-order scenario). No ops
burden, no hosting cost, no service to keep alive. It fits OSE's distributed-
production ethos — anyone can fork the repo and run their own copy.

**Cost.** The browser has no geometry kernel. It cannot *create* geometry; it can
only pack pre-baked solids (`fcstd.js` injects translations into pre-generated
BREPs). New shapes must be generated offline via FreeCAD (`build_lib.py`). Anything
that needs server-side state — e.g. live build-status tracking on a traveller —
breaks this constraint and is a real decision to revisit, not a free addition.

## 2. A door is a window taken to the floor — apertures are one parametric family

Windows and doors are a single `aperture_wall_panel` family driven by an `aperture`
block, not two separate code paths.

**Why.** They share the same king/jack/header/cripple framing logic. One path means
one place to fix a framing bug and no drift between "window framing" and "door
framing."

**Cost.** The single family carries the union of cases (sill present or absent,
swing geometry and conflict-checking for doors), so conditional complexity is
concentrated in one family rather than spread across two simpler ones.

## 3. Geometry over heuristics

Where there's a choice between computing real geometry and applying a rule of
thumb, compute the geometry. The door swing-conflict guard checks actual sector
overlap from the drawn arcs; snapping uses real port and seam positions; the part
library is built from computed member positions, never estimated.

**Why.** The geometry is ground truth, so it doesn't accumulate the edge-case
failures that heuristics do (the rejected run-based and grid compilers below are the
evidence). Correctness is structural rather than patched.

**Cost.** More math up front, and slower to write than a shortcut would be.

## 4. Orthogonal document model — levels, layers, entities

An entity carries `level`, `layer`, and side as independent attributes, rather than
the model being a flat list of walls.

**Why.** It is the slot for two planned capabilities that don't exist yet:
multi-story (levels) and trades such as electrical/plumbing/HVAC (layers). With the
orthogonal model, those slot in without a model rewrite. (See decision 5b for the
intent this slot exists to serve.)

**Cost.** More abstraction than today's single-story, structural-only tool strictly
needs — a deliberate bet on future generality that is currently unpaid (the
multi-story UI isn't built yet).

## 5. Text and AI-friendly formats throughout

YAML is the single source of truth; layouts are JSON; logs are plain text; every
generated artifact comes from a deterministic generator.

**Why.** These formats are diffable, version-controllable, reproducible, and legible
to both humans and AI agents — an agent can read and edit a spec directly. This
makes distributed and AI-assisted contribution practical.

**Cost.** Not the most compact representation; accepts some redundancy in exchange
for transparency.

## 5b. Framing is the backbone — trades derive from it, and the tool flows

*(Directional decision — committed in principle, not yet built. Recorded because
it's the intent the layer model exists to serve, and the decision most easily
violated by someone who doesn't know it.)*

The structural framing is the authored source of truth. The other tabs (electrical,
plumbing, HVAC) are primarily **auto-generated from the framing** via best-practice
rules — reviewable, and eventually supporting manual entry as overrides. The
intended UX is a true sequence — first tab to last to export — not a set of
independent tabs you switch between.

**Why.** Every trade is spatially constrained by the framing (an outlet lives in a
stud bay, a wire follows a channel). Deriving trades from the framing is both less
work for the user and more correct than drawing each trade independently. A user
override is treated as a logged deviation from the default, which carries a cost —
so deviations are explicit, not silent.

**Cost.** Auto-generated trades are **best-practice defaults, not engineered MEP**.
They must be presented as "starting layout, review required," never as a finished
electrical/plumbing plan. The override mechanism (a user edit as a recorded
exception on the entity) is real work that must exist before manual entry is safe.

## 6. Derived artifacts are generated, not hand-maintained — and kept honest by tests

`wall_instances.yaml` is authored; everything else (`specs.json`, the per-direction
BREPs, `volumes.json`, thumbnails, the `.FCStd` library) is generated from it by
`build_lib.py` — one command, reproducible. The browser export and the Python
compiler are held to identical blocking geometry by `tests/parity.mjs` in CI.

**Why.** A derived artifact can't drift from its source by hand, and the
browser-vs-compiler agreement is verified mechanically rather than discovered in the
field — which is what lets "the browser export equals the compiler" be a true claim
rather than an aspiration.

**Cost.** A contributor can't hand-edit a derived file; they change the source and
regenerate, which needs FreeCAD for the geometry step. (The operational *how* of this
contract lives in `AGENTS.md`; this entry records the *why*.)

**Directional — partially built.** The artifact pipeline above is built and live. But
the framing-math *implementation* still lives in more than one place (the browser
exporter, the Python compiler, the 3D view); the parity test guarantees they agree,
which means they are kept-in-sync duplicates, not yet a single source. Consolidating
them into one member enumerator is planned (see the build-documentation scoping) and
would turn the parity test from a divergence guard into refactor insurance. A related
known gap: `pricing.json`'s member counts are still hand-authored, not derived from
geometry.

## Rejected alternatives — the compiler genealogy

Recorded because they are the evidence behind decision 3 and the current
placement model. All are preserved on the [`legacy`](https://gitlab.com/collindesantis/iconic-cad/-/tree/legacy)
branch.

- **Run-clustering (Marcin's original).** Clustered icons into N/S/E/W runs and
  walked them sequentially. Handled rectangular buildings only.
- **Port-based BFS.** Graph traversal using port markers in the CAD files. Had a
  corner-alignment bug at perpendicular connections.
- **Grid placement.** Placed modules on a uniform grid. Failed because non-square
  modules don't fit a grid.
- **Run-based (SVG auto-detect).** Auto-detected wall runs from SVG and connected
  them with dimension math. Complex and fragile at inner corners.

**The current approach** — explicit entity placements with user-controlled port
snapping — won because it handles non-rectangular, non-grid, arbitrary-corner
layouts, and it puts the user in control of which corners connect rather than trying
to infer intent from geometry.
